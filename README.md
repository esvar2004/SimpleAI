This application is hosted on Streamlit. You simply have to provide the API key to access OpenAI. Afterwards, the application should work smoothly and return results.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/esvar2004/SimpleAI.git
```

Install Dependencies

```bash
  pip install pandas streamlit openai
```

Start the server.

```bash
  streamlit run data.py
```

This should automatically open up a local server that you can interact with.
